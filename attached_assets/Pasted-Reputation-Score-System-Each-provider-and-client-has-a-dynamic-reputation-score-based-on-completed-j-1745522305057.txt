Reputation Score System
Each provider and client has a dynamic reputation score based on completed jobs, feedback, on-time availability, and dispute history — helps build long-term trust.

GPU Benchmark Verification
Auto-run standardized benchmarks on provider GPUs during listing to validate specs (e.g., CUDA cores, memory bandwidth) and detect spoofing.

Job Snapshot & Rollback
Allows clients to checkpoint long-running jobs and resume from last snapshot — useful in case of provider failure or container timeout.

Anomaly Detection & Fraud Prevention
Use lightweight AI models to flag suspicious provider activity — like excessive container restarts, resource underutilization, or job output mismatches.

Custom Docker Environments
Clients can upload their own Dockerfiles or use templates — ensuring compatibility with specialized frameworks (e.g., PyTorch nightly, JAX, DeepSpeed).

Energy Efficiency Mode
Let providers toggle an eco-mode, favoring clients with low-intensity jobs — optimizing for heat, electricity use, and eco-conscious users.

Interactive Metrics Dashboard
Both clients and providers get real-time dashboards with logs, graphs, and alerts — GPU temp, memory, utilization, job runtime, etc.

Dispute Resolution Escrow
Smart contract–based dispute mechanism with third-party arbitrators. If a job fails or gets corrupted, payment is held until both parties agree or arbitration resolves it.

Multi-GPU & Multi-Node Job Support
For large jobs, allow clients to parallelize across multiple GPUs or providers with automatic job partitioning and result merging.

Offline Availability Credit
Providers get credits for declaring downtime in advance — encouraging honesty and planning, and preventing job disruptions.

Job Template Marketplace
Users can share or sell job configuration templates — e.g., "Stable Diffusion training", "BERT fine-tuning", etc. with environment + config bundled.

Privacy Visualizer
Show a real-time visualization of data flow, container runtime, and encryption stages — so users see exactly how secure their job is.

Provider Hardware Wallet Support
For crypto payouts, support hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) directly on payout screen — improving security of provider earnings.
